### 🌩️ About Me

I'm an **AWS DevOps Engineer with 4 years of professional experience** in designing, implementing, and managing cloud-based infrastructure.  
I specialize in **CI/CD pipelines, automation, and infrastructure as code (IaC)** using tools like **Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes**.  

Every week, I’m building **hands-on DevOps projects** to strengthen my expertise and contribute open-source automation scripts for others to learn.
